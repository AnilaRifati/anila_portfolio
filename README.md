# Anila's portfolio intro
Welcome to my portfolio, where I would like to show all of my school projects that I have worked on since the journey of my college years. 
It may not be much but for me working on these projects helped me learn more about myself as an individual who didn't know much about her abilities, capacity to hard work, or ambition for something truly significant to determent a long healthy future in technology. 
These projects helped me expand my creativity and also be a detail-seeker(well not that extreme but still(>_<)). I also had a lot a fun working on these little school projects with the help of my favorite songs on my music playlist(well mostly metal rock) and with the help of my friends. 
I hope to continue to improve my skills, widen my work and create amazing projects in the future.
I hope whomever can see my work will enjoy it.(^-^)
Thank you and have a nice day wherever you are.
From Anila <3
